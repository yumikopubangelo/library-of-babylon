## Overview

Write a concise, high-level description of the song (2-4 sentences):
- What is the song about at its core?
- What is the dominant emotional tone? (melancholic, triumphant, introspective, energetic, etc.)
- What makes this song distinctive or memorable?

Example:
"Comet" is a powerful ballad about loneliness and perseverance, centered around the metaphor of a solitary comet traveling through the cosmos. The song captures the duality of isolation and determination, expressing both the pain of being alone and the beauty of pursuing one's path despite it. Suisei's passionate vocal delivery elevates the emotional weight of the lyrics, making it one of her most iconic original works.

## Themes

Identify 3-6 core themes present in the work:
- Loneliness / Isolation
- Perseverance / Determination
- Self-discovery
- Cosmic imagery / Scale
- Hope despite hardship
- Individual vs. collective

Each theme should be 1-2 words, bullet-pointed.

## Lyrical Analysis

### Narrative Arc

Describe the story or emotional journey of the song:
- What is the narrative structure? (beginning -> middle -> end)
- Who is the speaker/protagonist?
- What journey do they undergo?
- How does the mood shift throughout the song?

Consider verse 1 -> chorus -> verse 2 -> bridge -> final chorus progression.

### Key Lines & Interpretation

Choose 3-5 significant lines that capture the essence of the work.
For each line:

> "Quoted lyric line here"

**Interpretation:** 
Explain the emotional or symbolic meaning of this line.

Example:

> "Like a comet"

**Interpretation:** 
The comet metaphor serves as the central image of the song. Comets are beautiful yet solitary, traveling vast distances through empty space. This reflects the speaker's sense of isolation while pursuing their dreams - beautiful and determined, but fundamentally alone.

```
はしゃいだな
夜はもう折り返しらしい
羽を休める戦士たち
たしかにどこでもない場所さここは
昨日ならドアの外に置いてきた
ほら華のない奇跡が
音に乗ってやってくる
星空みたいな光の隅っこで
銀河系みたいな輪になるカーニバル
僕の目も回っているよ
いまなら世界を変えられるような
僕が変えられるような
気がして いた
今日も願ってる
こないでこないで次の朝よ
踊っていたいよ僕ら死ぬまで
不安定で歪なこの場所で 笑いあってさ
意味のない秘密を交わしながら
夢を見てる
One, two で世界を変えたくて
こないでこないで次の朝よ
気づいたら
君の散漫な話が
僕の簡単な眠りをかき消す
飽和したおかしなベースラインの中
二人で世界を変えにいく夢
君と変えにいく夢
見た気がした
3時12分
ずっと願ってる
こないでこないで次の朝よ
踊っていたいよ僕ら死ぬまで
不安定で歪なこの場所で
ずっと願ってる
こないでこないで次の朝よ
踊っていたいよ僕ら死ぬまで
同じ曲が好きってそれだけで肩を組んでさ
君のいない秘密はつまらないんだ
夢を見せて
One, two で世界を変えにいこう
One, two で世界を変えにいこうぜ
```

```
We kicked up our heels
Seems halfway through the night
Warriors resting their wings
Surely this is nowhere
Here

I’ve left yesterday behind outside the door
Look, an understated miracle
Comes riding on a sound

In the corner of the light of the starry sky
Carnival of becoming a circle like the Galaxy
My head is also spinning
Felt like I could change the world now
Felt as if
I could
Change it

Hoping today as ever
May the next morning never come, never come
Wanna keep dancing till we die
Laughing with one another in this unstable and distorted place
Exchanging meaningless secrets
Dreaming a dream
Wanting to change the world after counting one, two

May the next morning never come, never come

Before I know it
Your ramblings
Disturb my effortless sleep
Within the oddly saturated baseline
A dream to go change the world, just the two of us
A dream to go change the world with you
Felt like I saw it

3:12

Ever hoping
May the next morning never come, never come
Wanna keep dancing till we die
In this unstable and distorted place
Ever hoping

May the next morning never come, never come
Wanna keep dancing till we die
With our arms around each other’s shoulders just because we like the same song
Secrets without you are just boring
Show your dream
One, two, let’s go change the world

One, two, let’s go change the world
```

## Founder's Notes

This is YOUR section. Write subjectively and personally.

Why does this song matter to YOU specifically?
- What emotions does it evoke?
- What memories or experiences does it connect to?
- Why did you choose to preserve it?
- What do you hope future archivists or listeners will understand?

This is the heart of why this archive exists. Be honest, be personal, be human.

Example:
"Comet" was the first original song by Suisei that made me truly understand the weight of her journey. The metaphor of isolation in pursuit of dreams resonated deeply with me - anyone who has worked on something alone, unseen, understands this pain. When I archive this song, I'm preserving not just audio data, but the crystallization of that very real human experience of loneliness, hope, and perseverance. This is why digital creators matter. This is why their stories deserve preservation.
