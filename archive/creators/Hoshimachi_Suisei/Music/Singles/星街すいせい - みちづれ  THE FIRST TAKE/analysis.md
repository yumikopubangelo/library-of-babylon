## Overview

Write a concise, high-level description of the song (2-4 sentences):
- What is the song about at its core?
- What is the dominant emotional tone? (melancholic, triumphant, introspective, energetic, etc.)
- What makes this song distinctive or memorable?

Example:
"Comet" is a powerful ballad about loneliness and perseverance, centered around the metaphor of a solitary comet traveling through the cosmos. The song captures the duality of isolation and determination, expressing both the pain of being alone and the beauty of pursuing one's path despite it. Suisei's passionate vocal delivery elevates the emotional weight of the lyrics, making it one of her most iconic original works.

## Lyrical Analysis

### Narrative Arc

Describe the story or emotional journey of the song:
- What is the narrative structure? (beginning -> middle -> end)
- Who is the speaker/protagonist?
- What journey do they undergo?
- How does the mood shift throughout the song?

Consider verse 1 -> chorus -> verse 2 -> bridge -> final chorus progression.

### Key Lines & Interpretation

Choose 3-5 significant lines that capture the essence of the work.
For each line:

> "Quoted lyric line here"

**Interpretation:** 
Explain the emotional or symbolic meaning of this line.

Example:

> "Like a comet"

**Interpretation:** 
The comet metaphor serves as the central image of the song. Comets are beautiful yet solitary, traveling vast distances through empty space. This reflects the speaker's sense of isolation while pursuing their dreams - beautiful and determined, but fundamentally alone.

## Founder's Notes

This is YOUR section. Write subjectively and personally.

Why does this song matter to YOU specifically?
- What emotions does it evoke?
- What memories or experiences does it connect to?
- Why did you choose to preserve it?
- What do you hope future archivists or listeners will understand?

This is the heart of why this archive exists. Be honest, be personal, be human.

Example:
"Comet" was the first original song by Suisei that made me truly understand the weight of her journey. The metaphor of isolation in pursuit of dreams resonated deeply with me - anyone who has worked on something alone, unseen, understands this pain. When I archive this song, I'm preserving not just audio data, but the crystallization of that very real human experience of loneliness, hope, and perseverance. This is why digital creators matter. This is why their stories deserve preservation.
